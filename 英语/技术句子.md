- It includes an introduction to Spring Boot, along with installation instructions
- Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run、
- Spring Boot 3.1.2 requires Java 17 and is compatible up to and including Java 20
- If you are new to Java development or if you want to experiment with Spring Boot
- Maven POM file inherits from the spring-boot-starter-parent project and declares dependencies to one or more “Starters”
- it is a quick way to get a Spring application off the ground without an IDE.
- highlights some of Spring Boot’s key features.
- You can shortcut the steps below by going to start.spring.io and choosing the "Web" starter from the dependencies searcher
- For simplicity, we continue to use a plain text editor for this example
- “Starters” provide dependencies that you are likely to need when developing a specific type of application
- by default, Maven and Gradle compile sources from xxx
- It provides hints for people reading the code and for Spring that the class plays a specific role
- Executable jars (sometimes called “fat jars”) are archives containing your compiled classes
  along with all of the jar dependencies that your code needs to run.
- A  jar packages all the classes from all the application’s dependencies into a single archive

- When you upgrade Spring Boot itself, these dependencies are upgraded as well in a consistent way.
- Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application

- start your application with the --debug switch
- If you find that specific auto-configuration classes that you do not want are being applied, you can use the exclude attribute of @SpringBootApplication to disable them
